            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Kaiden Parcher I was born and raised in Port Townsend, WA. During college I lived in a few different places in the Seattle-Tacoma. I also spent a year down in Eugene, OR. I was lucky enough to get a scholarship to play college basketball, but after the pandemic hit, I knew my sports career was over and it was time to find a new passion. I have always loved learning and loved challenges. So I went and got my real estate license and became the youngest active broker in my county. Now I am turning to a new challenge in Full Stack Development, where I am excited to learn, grow and change everyday!
