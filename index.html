            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p> Welcome! Thanks for checking out my portfolio, let me tell you how I got here! When the pandemic hit and my college basketball career ended, I knewit was time to find a new passion. I have always loved learning and loved challenges. So I went and got my real estate license and became the youngest active broker in my county. I love the people I work with, and the energy of sales, but now I am turning to a new challenge in Full Stack Development. Where I am excited to learn, grow and change everyday!
