# My Portfolio

## Description 

This Portfolio was created to highlight my talents to potential employers. At the top there is a Nav bar to lead you to the main sections of my page, including About me, Projects, and Contact Info. I built the skeleton of this HTML using a grid, and assigned the grid's particular information. 


Although this portfolio is small and bland, I plan to continually add to it as my skills improve. There will also be a chance to upload many more projects as this class moves along.
